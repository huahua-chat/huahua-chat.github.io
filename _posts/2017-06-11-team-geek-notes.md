## Background

My boss recommended me Team Geek recently. This is a book about managing software engineers. I think now it is an ideal time for me to read about it and connect the points described in book with what has actually happened in the real workplace.

## Chapter 1 - The Myth of the Genius Programmer

    - lose the ego
        - build a sense of team accomplishment and group pride
    - deal out and handle criticism
        - constructive criticism wgucg us imbued with respect
