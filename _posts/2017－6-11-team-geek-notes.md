## Background

My boss recommended me Team Geek recently. This is a book about managing software engineers. I think now it is an ideal time for me to read about it and connect the points described in book with what has actually happened in the real workplace.

## Chapter 1 - The Myth of the Genius Programmer

- Humans have a natural instinct to locate leaders and role models, idolize them, and attempt to imitate them.
    - We all secretly wish to be geniuses
- Hiding is considered harmful
    - Hiding great ideas is like gambling
    - Bus factor
    - Rapid feedback loop while working inside a team
